# Hey There! 👋

The name's Amin, the Data Whisperer. With over 8 years in the field, I've been around the block a few times, modeling, analyzing, and generally getting my hands dirty in all things data. My special powers? Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Bayesian Modelling. My secret weapon? A PhD in Statistics.

## 🎓 Always Learning!

They say I'm a doctor, but not the kind that can save you from a heart attack. Unless it's caused by a data problem – in that case, I'm your guy. I hold a PhD in Statistics, and I use it to dissect data, dig out hidden insights and create an understanding from the chaos.

## 💻 Technical Jazz

Python and R are the languages I speak when I'm talking to data. Python to me is like the superhero of the programming world, always ready to jump in and save the day. And R, well, that's the sidekick that you never knew you needed but can't live without.

## 🤝 Let's Make Some Data Magic Together

I'm as open to collaboration as a freshly initialized Jupyter notebook. If you've got some interesting ideas or challenging problems, let's get together and weave some data magic.

## 🏀 Not Just A Data Nerd

Away from the computer, you'll find me on the basketball court. Because, let's face it, even Data Scientists need to get some sunlight! And there's nothing like the smell of the court and the sound of a well-shot ball swooshing through the net.

## Holler At Me!

So, if you're looking for a chat about data science, a potential collaboration, or the latest basketball game, feel free to reach out. My GitHub profile is like a 24/7 open house party – everyone's welcome, and there's always something happening!

Enjoy exploring, and remember, in data we trust!
