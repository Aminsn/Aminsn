# Hello there! 👋

I'm Amin, a seasoned Data Scientist with over 8 years of experience in the field. Specializing in Bayesian Statistical Modelling, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, I've been using my unique skill set to unravel the truths hidden within data and derive meaningful insights from it.

## 🎓 Educational Background

I hold a PhD in Statistics, which forms the foundation of my deep understanding and skills in data analytics. My education has always been my guiding light while maneuvering through the vast seas of data and drawing out patterns that others might overlook.

## 💻 Technical Skills

My toolkit includes Python and R, which I primarily use to apply machine learning models, deep learning techniques, and Bayesian modelling. My expertise in these programming languages allows me to approach data problems with a unique perspective and yield effective solutions.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects in the realm of Data Science. The dynamism of this field is what drives me, and I believe that great things can be achieved when brilliant minds collaborate.

## 🏀 A Bit More About Me

When I'm not crunching numbers or tuning models, you'll find me on the basketball court. Playing basketball not only keeps me fit but also instills in me the spirit of teamwork and leadership, which I find vital in my professional life.
